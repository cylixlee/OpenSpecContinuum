- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to \`openspec/AGENTS.md\` (located inside the \`openspec/\` directory—run \`ls openspec\` or \`openspec update\` if you don't see it) if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.`;

const proposalGuardrails = `${baseGuardrails}\n- Identify any vague or ambiguous details and ask the necessary follow-up questions before editing files.
- Do not write any code during the proposal stage. Only create design documents (proposal.md, tasks.md, design.md, and spec deltas). Implementation happens in the apply stage after approval.`;

const proposalSteps = `**Steps**
1. Review \`openspec/project.md\`, run \`openspec list\` and \`openspec list --specs\`, and inspect related code or docs (e.g., via \`rg\`/\`ls\`) to ground the proposal in current behaviour; note any gaps that require clarification.
2. Choose a unique verb-led \`change-id\` and scaffold \`proposal.md\`, \`tasks.md\`, and \`design.md\` (when needed) under \`openspec/changes/<id>/\`.
3. Map the change into concrete capabilities or requirements, breaking multi-scope efforts into distinct spec deltas with clear relationships and sequencing.
4. Capture architectural reasoning in \`design.md\` when the solution spans multiple systems, introduces new patterns, or demands trade-off discussion before committing to specs.
5. Draft spec deltas in \`changes/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md\` (one folder per capability) using \`## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements\` with at least one \`#### Scenario:\` per requirement and cross-reference related capabilities when relevant.
6. Draft \`tasks.md\` as an ordered list of small, verifiable work items that deliver user-visible progress, include validation (tests, tooling), and highlight dependencies or parallelizable work.
7. Validate with \`openspec validate <id> --strict\` and resolve every issue before sharing the proposal.`;


const proposalReferences = `**Reference**
- Use \`openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only\` or \`openspec show <spec> --type spec\` to inspect details when validation fails.
- Search existing requirements with \`rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs\` before writing new ones.
- Explore the codebase with \`rg <keyword>\`, \`ls\`, or direct file reads so proposals align with current implementation realities.`;

const applySteps = `**Steps**
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. Read \`changes/<id>/proposal.md\`, \`design.md\` (if present), and \`tasks.md\` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
2. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change.
3. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in \`tasks.md\` is finished.
4. Update the checklist after all work is done so each task is marked \`- [x]\` and reflects reality.
5. Reference \`openspec list\` or \`openspec show <item>\` when additional context is required.`;

const applyReferences = `**Reference**
- Use \`openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only\` if you need additional context from the proposal while implementing.`;

const refineGuardrails = `${baseGuardrails}\n- Do not edit production code during refine. Only update \`openspec/changes/<id>/\` files (proposal, tasks, design, and spec deltas).\n- Use the user's refinement request to drive the updates; ask clarifying questions if the requested adjustments are unclear.\n- If the request expands beyond the approved change scope, stop and recommend creating a new change proposal instead of refining.`;

const refineSteps = `**Steps**
1. Determine the change ID to refine:
   - If this prompt includes a change ID (for example inside a \`<ChangeId>\` block), use that value after trimming whitespace.
   - If the user provided a \`/openspec-refine <change-id> <adjustments>\` style input, parse the change ID and keep the remaining text as refinement instructions.
   - If the conversation references a change loosely, run \`openspec list\` to surface likely IDs, share the candidates, and confirm the intended change.
   - Otherwise, run \`openspec list\` and ask the user to confirm the change ID before proceeding.
2. Capture the refinement request from the prompt or user message; if the desired adjustments are missing or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before editing.
3. Read \`changes/<id>/proposal.md\`, \`design.md\` (if present), \`tasks.md\`, and the spec deltas under \`changes/<id>/specs/\` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
4. Update only the proposal, design, and spec delta files to reflect the requested adjustments (no code edits). Adjust technical decisions in \`design.md\` when needed.
5. If a spec delta changes, ensure requirements include \`#### Scenario:\` entries. If the requested behavior does not fit existing spec deltas, create additional spec delta files as needed.
6. Add or roll back tasks so the checklist matches the updated implementation plan.
7. Run \`openspec validate <id> --strict\` and fix any issues before reporting back.
8. State clearly that no code changes were made, summarize the refined proposal, and stop to request explicit re-approval before any apply work continues.`;

const refineReferences = `**Reference**
- Use \`openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only\` to inspect the current change deltas before editing.`;

const archiveSteps = `**Steps**
1. Determine the change ID to archive:
   - If this prompt already includes a specific change ID (for example inside a \`<ChangeId>\` block populated by slash-command arguments), use that value after trimming whitespace.
   - If the conversation references a change loosely (for example by title or summary), run \`openspec list\` to surface likely IDs, share the relevant candidates, and confirm which one the user intends.
   - Otherwise, review the conversation, run \`openspec list\`, and ask the user which change to archive; wait for a confirmed change ID before proceeding.
   - If you still cannot identify a single change ID, stop and tell the user you cannot archive anything yet.
2. Validate the change ID by running \`openspec list\` (or \`openspec show <id>\`) and stop if the change is missing, already archived, or otherwise not ready to archive.
3. Run \`openspec archive <id> --yes\` so the CLI moves the change and applies spec updates without prompts (use \`--skip-specs\` only for tooling-only work).
4. Review the command output to confirm the target specs were updated and the change landed in \`changes/archive/\`.
5. Validate with \`openspec validate --strict\` and inspect with \`openspec show <id>\` if anything looks off.`;

const archiveReferences = `**Reference**
- Use \`openspec list\` to confirm change IDs before archiving.
- Inspect refreshed specs with \`openspec list --specs\` and address any validation issues before handing off.`;

     - \`design.md\`: Understand the design approach and implementation details
     - \`tasks.md\`: Review the task list including completed and pending tasks
     - \`specs/\` directory: Review spec deltas (new/modified/deleted content) that will be applied to existing specs
6. Explore the source code to understand the actual implementation:
   - Identify the main source directories
   - Read key entry points and main modules to understand the project structure
   - For active proposals, explore the relevant source code files to understand:
     - Current implementation state
     - Code patterns and conventions used
     - How the proposed changes will integrate with existing code
   - Search for relevant code patterns, functions, or classes mentioned in the proposals
   - Review test files to understand expected behavior and testing conventions
7. Synthesize the information to form a comprehensive understanding of:
   - Project overview and goals
   - OpenSpec workflow and conventions
   - Existing specifications and guidelines
   - Source code structure and implementation patterns
   - Current active changes and their implementation status

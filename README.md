# OpenSpec Continuum

OpenSpec Continuum is a personal maintained, downstream version of [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec). In short, we do:

1. Sync with the upstream when a new version of OpenSpec is published.
2. Develop new features and publish to npm, under a different package scope.
3. Try to contribute back to the upstream when adequate.
